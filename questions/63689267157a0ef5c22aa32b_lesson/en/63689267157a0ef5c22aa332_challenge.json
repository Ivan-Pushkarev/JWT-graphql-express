  "name": "Is the pizza salesman telling the truth?",
  "instruction": "The pizza salesman says that large pizzas are more profitable than small ones. Let's check this statement with different diameters and prices.\n\nThe function `pizzaCompare` receives parameters:\n\n* `smallDiameter` - diameter of the small pizza,\n* `bigDiameter` - diameter of a large pizza,\n* `smallPrice` - price of a small pizza,\n* `bigPrice` - price of a large pizza.\n\nIf the large pizza is really more profitable, the function should return `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\nSolution algorithm:\n1. Find the area of the small pizza\n2. Find the area of the large pizza\n3. find the price per square centimeter of the small pizza\n4. Find the price per square centimeter of a large pizza\n5. Compare prices per square centimeter.\n6. Return the result of the comparison\n\nThe area of a circle is equal to `3.14 * radius ** 2`.\n\nHave you noticed that the function `pizzaCompare` has repetitive code? Try putting it in a separate function `getCircleArea` and calling it inside `pizzaCompare`.\n\nCreate a function `getCircleArea` that takes one parameter `diameter` and returns the area of the circle. Use this function inside `pizzaCompare`.\n\nThe `getCircleArea` function must be declared next to the `pizzaCompare` function, but not inside it. The function `pizzaCompare` must call the function `getCircleArea` inside itself.\n\nAn example of two functions:\n```javascript\nfunction getRoomArea(width, length) {\n  return width * length;\n}\n\nfunction twoRoomsAreaCompare(width1, length1, width2, length2) {\n  const area1 = getRoomArea(width1, length1);\n  const area2 = getRoomArea(width2, length2);\n  return area1 > area2;\n}\n```"
