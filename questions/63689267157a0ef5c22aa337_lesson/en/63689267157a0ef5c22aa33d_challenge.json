  "name": "Applying a discount to the purchase",
  "instruction": "The `discountPrint` function takes:\n\n`clientName` - customer name\n`pricePerBox` - price per box\n`boxCount` - number of boxes\n\nThe function must return a string of the form:\n`Hello Albert. Boxes: 5. Price: 100. Subtotal: 500. Discount: 4%. Total: 480.`\n\nThe discount must be applied to the total purchase amount.\n\n- `10%` - if amount is less than 100\n- `1%` - if amount from 100 to 250\n- `2%` - if amount is from 250 to 350\n- `3%` - if amount is from 350 to 450\n- `4%` - if amount is 450 or more\n\n\nTo solve this problem, use the following algorithm:\n1. Calculate `subtotal` - the total amount of the purchase, excluding the discount for this multiply `pricePerBox` by `boxCount`.\n2. Create a variable discount with an initial value of 0. `let discount = 0;`\n3. Calculate `discount` - a percentage discount for this use the conditional operator `if` and compare `subtotal` with different values\n\nAn example of a comparison:\n```javascript\nif (a &lt; 10) discount = 5;\nelse if (a &lt; 20) discount = 10;\nelse if (a &lt; 30) discount = 15;\nelse discount = 20;\n\n// This syntax is allowed for single-line actions\n// This is the same as:\nif (a < 10) {\n  discount = 5;\n} else if (a < 20) {\n  discount = 10;\n} else if (a < 30) {\n  discount = 15;\n} else {\n  discount = 20;\n}\n\n```\n\n4. Calculate `total` - the total purchase amount including the discount `subtotal - (subtotal * discount / 100)`.\n5. Use concatenation to create a string like `Hello Albert. Boxes: 5. Price: 100. Subtotal: 500. Discount: 4%. Total: 480.` and return it from the function"
