Programs are instructions for a computer.

The computer does everything only by instructions and does not (yet) have the ability to make decisions independently. So
programs are the only way we can give it commands.

Programs consist of instructions that the computer executes one at a time. Each instruction is a command that tells the computer what it should do.

For example, the "display text" instruction tells the computer to display the text we will write in the program.

Let's imagine that we have a robot. It can only follow the instructions we give it. What instructions can we give the robot?

An example of a not real program for a robot:


1. Take `10` steps forward
2. Turn left at `90` degrees
3. Take `5` steps forward
4. Turn right at `90` degrees
5. Measure the illuminance. If the illuminance is less than `50%`, turn on the flashlight
6. Make a short beep 
7. Take five steps backwards


Next, we will write programs for the computer. It will only do what we tell it to do.
